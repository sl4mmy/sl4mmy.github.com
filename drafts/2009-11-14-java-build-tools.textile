title: Java Build Tools: Ant vs. Maven
---

The best build tool is the one you write yourself.  Every project's build process is unique, and often individual projects need to be built multiple different ways.  It is impossible for tool authors to anticipate every build's requirements, and foolhardy to try ("Apache":http://jakarta.apache.org developers: take note).  The best any tool can do is provide a flexible library of reusable tasks that can easily be adapted to your needs, but even that is insufficient.  Off-the-shelf tasks never suit your project perfectly.  You will waste countless hours struggling to make those tasks do _exactly_ what you need, only to give up and write a plugin instead.  Writing your own custom build tool is quick and easy, and requires less maintenance than you fear.  Don't be afraid: builds should fit your project, not the other way around.

If you do not want to write your own build tool, then you should use "Rake":http://rake.rubyforge.org.  "Rake":http://rake.rubyforge.org is the best existing build tool for Java projects.  "Rake":http://rake.rubyforge.org provides a bunch of standard methods to perform common build tasks, and anything else can be quickly implemented in "Ruby":http://www.ruby-lang.org.  Writing build scripts in a real programming language gives "Rake":http://rake.rubyforge.org a huge advantage over other tools.  There are other advantages, too, but none are as important.

So, you should write your a custom build tool.  If you don't want to, then you should switch to "Rake":http://rake.rubyforge.org.  If you can't switch, you should lobby for the right to switch.  If politics drives technology decisions, if you will never be allowed to switch, then quit your job or leave the project; life is too short to while away your precious time using inferior tools for no good reason.

If you lack the courage to quit, then use "Ant":http://ant.apache.org.  "Ant":http://ant.apache.org is the second best existing build tool for Java projects.  Although inferior to "Rake":http://rake.rubyforge.org, "Ant":http://ant.apache.org is still a great build tool.  "Ant":http://ant.apache.org is mature and stable, it is fast, and it comes with a rich library of tasks.  "Ant":http://ant.apache.org makes it possible (but "not at all easy":http://alex-verkhovsky.blogspot.com/2009/03/lets-use-real-languages-for-builds.html) to script rich, complex builds processes custom-tailored to your project.

So, write your own build tool, or else use "Rake":http://rake.rubyforge.org.  Otherwise, switch to "Rake":http://rake.rubyforge.org, or fight to switch to "Rake":http://rake.rubyforge.org, or quit and go some place where you can use "Rake":http://rake.rubyforge.org.  And if all else fails, use "Ant":http://ant.apache.org until you can find a new job with a company using "Rake":http://rake.rubyforge.org.

That's it!  Those are the *only* choices I can recommend!  Because you never, *ever*, under _any_ circumstances want to use "Maven":http://maven.apache.org!

"Maven":http://maven.apache.org is a _horrible_ implementation of _bad_ ideas.  I believe someone, somewhere had a vision for "Maven":http://maven.apache.org that was sensible, if not seductive.  Unfortunately, "Maven":http://maven.apache.org development ran counter to any such vision, and the project was lead so far astray that it can never correct its course.  Soon, I expect "Maven":http://maven.apache.org development will collapse under the sheer bulk of its owns crapulence and condense into a singularity, swallowing every project it ever touched.

"Maven":http://maven.apache.org is a festering pile of crap with absolutely no redeeming qualities.  Everything "Maven":http://maven.apache.org advocates tell you is a lie:
