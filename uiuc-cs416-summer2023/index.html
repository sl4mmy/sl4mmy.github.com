      Annual Average Surface Temperature (°F)
    </h4>

      <p>
        Annual average surface temperatures have risen for the past forty years.
        In 2020, annual average surface temperatures in the northern hemisphere
        were 1.36 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the historical average
        temperature between 1901 and 2000.
        The previous record was only set four years prior, in 2016, when annual
        average temperatures were 1.34 degrees higher than the historical
        average.
      </p>

      <p>
        This chart plots annual average surface temperature anomalies, in
        degrees Fahrenheit, for the northern hemisphere from 1880 to 2022, the
        most recent year for which data is available.
        Anomalies are measured from the 1901-2000 historical average (mean).

        Unfortunately, we're all too familiar with rising temperatures in the U.S.
        Every year it feels like summer keeps getting hotter.
        Especially this year, with the July we're having!

        This map shows monthly average surface temperature anomalies, in
        degrees Fahrenheit, for the continental United States (data for Alaska
        and Hawaii was unavailable) from June 2022.
        Anomalies are measured from the 1901-2000 historical average (mean).

        Of course, averaging temperatures annually or monthly misses a lot of
        important details!
        Most people are familiar with local weather forecasts reporting
        temperatures in terms of "highs" and "lows."
      </p>

      <p>
        This chart shows daily high, low, and average temperatures in Chicago,
        IL from June 2022.
        The blue line plots the historical average temperature in Chicago on
        each day of June.
        The historical average is computed using official records from 1901 to
        2000.
